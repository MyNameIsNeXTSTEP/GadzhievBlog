## Introduction
Hi.

All of you know, i guess, since the collective and cooperative work in society has become sort of an instrument of reaching and achieving something, people recognised some regularity in it, controlling, "management" we should say.
But it always has been a problem with mixing up emotions, *psychology* and that *control* in a one process. So today we have a situation, as i see it, when in all industries the management mass separated in two general fields anyhow, or not evenly, they are so to say:

1. "We are about to reflect the **feelings** of others, be **emotional** and be in an active gaming **society**"
2. "We are **strongly focused** on our goals and **results**, people are people, but what we do is more important, we don't like to be **distracted**"

So i think 90% of the society is in this fork, clearly either in one or the other edge, while most part of people are in first type, as we could see it in our lives, businesses, politics, collectives.

So why be that, why general part of people in industry, and i'm talking in this sense first of all, are about *"team coupling"* and *"psychological relations"* rather than in *"business relationship"* and *"defined relationships"* ?

## Thoughts

My guess is - people are exited more of belonging to an abstract whole and joyful, prioritising itself rather then even though be real people with morals and contradictions, but stay focused on their goals, results, because it requires more power, energy, time, discipline, self work etc. And more then that, very likely, this common area of such a people from first group would ignore or dislike you, since you are *"against them"*, *"not with them"* and so onâ€¦

## How it shows up in IT
It's quite common in this business and companies, expecially
