## Introduction

Speaking of ChatGPT, as many people know recently the OpenAI introduced "new" 4o version. Believing to them, most advanced, generic, with cooler voice, image reading/generating power, more taught one.

Before for me it was a theory, but now i realized something interesting in the dev area specifically. As more developers and not only go for the quick, targeted and digest help to the AI, the more people are going to be lazy for the own researches, getting help from another people. Like that situation with stackoverflow. And i think in not a distant future we will really get tightly coupled with that, just a <u>tool</u>, then with our **own personal abilities to discover and start a not primitive thinking process**.

Yes, defenetly, to start a conversation with the <u>AI tool</u> you need to be specific and know how and what to ask, but still, it's just a primitive instrument that we more and more partnernig with.

## About my personal freshly experience.

I program a small project, studied some new libraries to work with and their docs, how can i use it and so on. One day i recognised i'n not getting it right and with unefficient spent of time. Of course i decieded to ask a GPT ML to help me. What i did ? I Asked every single question i could discover on myself, even though i had the needed tabs opened in my browser to search and study the techs. In first it was as i think necessary for me, because i wanted to get it in a short period of time, and yes, i studied it with the sense, to know how to use it as a specialist.

But then a thought was droped me that all that was in general a straight forward hack, as young students who did't prepare their homework for an exam would use cheatsheets under their tables. It was a cheetcode to get the right information in the thin period of time just to implement a feature or fix bugs.

Did i learned from it ?

Only because i realised my problem and decided to do it. And my whole point here is - I believe not so many people would want to do a full circle of receiving such a help, meaning getting it, using it, and then investigate it in the whole. Instead of just copy-pasting the anwers to an IDE and then talking to the prompt that it was raised an error, so please redo it correctly.

What do you think ?

Are we going to the world with less awareness of what is the information we seek for and use, as well being with the least awareness of the fact that we become less smart and incapable of communicating with other people and our own thought process to solve our problems if we continue to use the <u>AI tools</u> in that direction ?
