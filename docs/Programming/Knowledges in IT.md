## Introduction
The IT world has a gigantic information space, since it began with the essence of information itself and everything, that can be documented, saved, transported and shared.
This article represents my view on it and suggests how to overcome the situation of a real overwhelming and distracting information flow, what might be good, what might be bad and why ?
Let's start.

## Real brief history
The roots of it were formed when humanity recognized it could no longer live in the world without messages, emails, files… to be transported wherever you wish, without progressing in academics, studying, researche, scientific revolutions, and so on.

## Results today
Nowadays we have such a problem and at the same time a truly good platform in web network, i believe.
The goods and profits of that are clear:

1. Ability to learn almost everything being everywhere around the world (just having some money for a laptop and internet connection)
2. The **[wikinomics](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B0)**, which allow us to contribute and evolve processes, companies, and real deals, even though do not knowing *who is up on the other end of a line*
3. A relatively endless source of different knowledges *(both useful and harmful)*
4. Online business with low risk and high margin

Problems, as I see it for now:

1. That exact relatively endless source of different knowledge
2. Comprehensively pushing on eyes ads of what you might not need
3. Distraction by new and interesting technologies for those, who don't need it, yet they could not know it and would find themselves a couple years later thinking that he/she should have had prioritize wishes before now
4. A huge variety of **real and true** & **far-fetched and fake** ideas, principles, approaches

## What to do with what and how
First, my general point here is: do not try to get everything and in a short time, rather think and cut off everything superfluous now, form priorities, find reliable and professional sources of data, information, exercises, move along them.
Follow some sort of **[kaidzen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen)** planning, little step by step go to your goals, which must be incremental and small too. Free your important and valuable time for specific studying, how to program in a new language, how to use this tool, what this system is and how i works. BUT…

Do not try to think like you do it so, but constantly distracting on something else, even when you learn new stuff, it must be, i think, not just for learning itself, but for a little step further in real life, in a project, in experience, in some summary in the company, in some valuable stuff for others. Do not when reading about some features of a technology, go deeper and deeper in winding paths, losing understanding and meaning of what was really needed at the start.

My suggestions are:

- Focus on one thing per moment of time.
    It means, if you recaftor some code for a ticket in one place, do not go while it to another, yet it may be important, and fix it too. Instead, just mark some places for it and return to them later, if they're not so short and quick for this work.
- Imagine and write down the plan^ the roadmap, stick to it.
- If you have to learn something new, what you need or want, got JUST for it, no further. if it's not causing any other problems or you really need right now to hop up into it.
- Free the amount of necessary energy/power and time for it, do not *fire this fuel* for extra and not correlated to the point.

## Conclusion
Today we face a lot of flashy banners and media pushing us to get associated with it, be sceptical in mind, try to figure out how can help me, but FIRSTLY before it, you need to know at least what you need at general, and only then seek for instruments, resources, people and other stuff to get your job be done well.

When you see on some site *"The X principle is a better one…"* or *"Technology Y is gone in past…"* or *"You should do only so…"*.
Become an appraiser, a researcher, sort out the issue if it worries or interests you, structure the information in your head and on some medium, try to find the pros and cons, and only then decide whether it is necessary or not.
